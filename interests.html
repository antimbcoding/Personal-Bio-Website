            <p>One of my biggest passions lies in the intersection of technology and art, particularly through the use
                of TouchDesigner. This powerful tool allows me to create stunning visualizations by combining AI,
                complex mathematics, and real-time rendering. Whether I'm experimenting with generative art, interactive
                installations, or immersive visual effects, I love pushing the boundaries of what's possible. It's
                fascinating to see how algorithms can transform data into captivating visuals, and I'm constantly
                learning new techniques to enhance my projects. The fusion of logic and creativity in TouchDesigner is
                something that truly excites me, and I’m always exploring new ways to bring my ideas to life.</p>
            <div id="im"><img class="image" src="images/peaky.jpg" alt="peaky blinders" style="width:536px; height:334px"></div>
            <p>When I’m not immersed in tech, you can often find me unwinding with some of my favorite TV shows. I'm a huge fan of "Peaky Blinders" with its gritty storytelling and sharp dialogue, "One Piece" for its epic world-building and unforgettable characters, and "Breaking Bad" for its intense drama and complex character arcs. Each of these shows offers something different, whether it's the thrill of a well-executed heist, the adventures of Luffy and his crew on the Grand Line, or the moral dilemmas faced by Walter White. These series have left a lasting impact on me, not just as entertainment but as masterclasses in storytelling.</p>
            <div id="im"><img class="image" src="images/videopro.jpg" alt="video" style="width:536px; height:334px"></div>
            <p>Another one of my creative outlets is video production. I enjoy creating personal videos that range from documenting everyday moments to crafting more polished projects with a narrative arc. Whether I'm shooting footage, editing clips, or adding effects, the entire process is a rewarding experience. I often incorporate techniques I've learned from my work as a Web Designer Intern and my experiments with TouchDesigner to make my videos stand out. It’s always satisfying to see a project come together, and sharing my work on platforms like YouTube allows me to connect with others who share similar interests.</p>
            <div id="im"><img class="image" src="images/baldurs.jpg" alt="games" style="width:536px; height:334px"></div>
            <p>Of course, it’s not all work and no play! I love spending time with friends, especially when it involves hiking, gaming, or playing board and card games. There's something about the fresh air and challenge of a good hike that clears the mind and sparks great conversations. When it comes to gaming, I'm a big fan of "Baldur's Gate 3" for its deep storytelling and character customization, "Persona 5" for its stylish design and engaging turn-based combat, and "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky" for its nostalgic, heartwarming adventures. For a quick and fun game night, "Exploding Kittens" always brings out the competitive spirit in everyone. These activities are a great way to relax, have fun, and build memories with friends.</p>
