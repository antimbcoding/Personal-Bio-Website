    <h2>Quick Bio</h2>
    <h3>
      Hey there!<br><br>I'm a junior at Stony Brook University, where I'm diving deep into the world of Computer Science as part of the Class of 2026. My journey started halfway across the globe in Bangladesh, where I was born, but life took an exciting turn when my family moved to the U.S. when I was just a year old. Since then, Brooklyn, NY has been my home, and it's where I've grown up surrounded by the energy and diversity that make this city so special.<br><br>

      My love for technology sparked during my time at Brooklyn Technical High School, one of the largest and most challenging specialized high schools in NYC. It's there that I realized just how much I enjoy solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life through code. That passion has only grown since I joined the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook, where I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can do.<br><br>

      Currently, I'm working as a Web Designer Intern at Stony Brook University, where I've had the opportunity to flex my creative and technical skills. I've edited over 100 pages using XML/XSL, providing fresh and engaging content for the university's web presence. On top of that, I bring my design flair to the SBU Student Affairs social media channels, crafting visually compelling posts that resonate with students. Utilizing Google Analytics, I've been able to boost webpage engagement by 23%, a milestone I'm particularly proud of.<br><br>

      Outside of classes, you'll often find me exploring new tech trends, working on personal projects, or collaborating with fellow students on innovative ideas. I'm excited about what the future holds and can't wait to make my mark
      in the tech world!<br><br>
